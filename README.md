Get it on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/?dev_acc=15931450086873854169#MarketListingPlace:p=com.gmail.rixx.justin.sieveoferatosthenes)!

This app takes the math behind the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V08g_lkKj6Q) and applies it to an android app. You can easily check if a number is prime, with absolute certainty in an instant.

The inspiration for this came from my Discrete Mathematics class. Once this idea clicked in my head, I thought it would be easy to implement as an Android app with some fancy-dancy UI on top. It's the easiest app I know of to check if a number is prime near instantly. Honestly, not a lot of uses, but a really cool concept to take old math and marry it with a modern, global software platform like Android.

Hope you enjoy, I had a fabulous time making this! Forks are welcome. Suggestions are welcome.
